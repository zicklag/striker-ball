# Striker Ball

Striker Ball is Ktech Studios first ever game! This fun, soccer-like minigame is
best played with a set of four players, but it can also be played 1v1 or 2v1
with twin stick controls.

Striker Ball serves as an example of what the Bones Game Engine is capable of
doing. Though small scale, Striker Ball has become our testing ground for some
of the major features you need in a finished game.
